                       MILITARY AND WAR IN CONQUER

Conquer permits both players and the computer to draft a variety
of unit types via the 'D'raft command.  Ships can be created via
the 'C'onstruct command.  Units differ in combat ability, movement
rate, and costs.  Some unit types have prerequisite powers.  For
example, as detailed on the next two tables, a archer unit requires
the drafting nation to have ARCHER power, and costs 100 talons and 
100 metal points per soldier to draft.  Archer units move at 1 times
the nations default movement rate, and fight at +10% if they are
defending.  The special list shows that archers gain special combat
advantages in certain circumstances.  In other words, archers cost the 
same as infantry, but fight slightly better (so if you have ARCHER power, 
you will draft Archers, not Infantry).

                          ADDITIONAL NOTES ON UNITS

INFANTRY     are the default units. You can't get them if you have any powers 
             (ARCHER, VAMPIRE, or any MONSTER) which change your default unit.
DRAGOONS     are cavalry that fight on foot as regular infantry.  They move
             as cavalry but fight as infantry.
ARCHERS      gain bonuses when fighting cavalry or near fortifcations.  They
             get an additional +15%*(percent of cavalry/knight opponents)
             and gain +15% defending & +5% attacking forts/cities... They
             don't get the bonus vs cavalry if they are in a fort.
MERCENARIES  are drafted from the world mercenary pool and thus don't deplete 
             your nations population when hired.  Only 1/2 your troops can
             be mercenaries.  They must be paid their enlistment cost to 
             disband them.  They have a tendency to run away from combats if
             outnumbered.  Mercenary combat bonuses are independent of the
             drafting nations bonus, and are based on an average worldwide
             mercenary combat bonus.
CAVALRY/KNIGHTS get -20% attacking or defending fortress.

note.  you can purchase non catapult/seige/knight/elephant units even if 
you have inadequate iron reserves if you pay triple their enlistment cost.

                          ADDITIONAL NOTES ON UNITS p.2

SIEGE_ENGINES add +1%/20 men *TO WHOLE COMBAT* attacking fortress (max +30%)
             siege engines can damage any fortifications they attack.
CATAPULTS    add +1%/40 men *TO WHOLE COMBAT* in normal combat (max +10%)
             add +1%/20 men *TO WHOLE COMBAT* when defending castle (max +10%)
             catapults can damage any fortifications they attack.
PHALANX &    Phalanx and Legionaries get an additional +10 combat bonus if in
LEGIONARY       500+ men units +20 combat bonus if in 1000+ men units
ROC/GRIFFON  units have the ability of flight.
NINJA        units ignore enemy zones of control
SAILOR       units may disembark from ships into unowned sectors.
MARINE       units are the only units that can disembark from ships in another
             nation's territory.
             marines also have excellent combat ability while aboard ships.
ZOMBIE       units are just plain dumb.  They don't know how to MARCH, only
             use half of a forts defenses and cannot even play follow the
             leader.  But, to the horror of their enemies, they obsorb 33% of
             the enemy dead into their ranks.
SPY          units are never captured and start in another nations capitol
SCOUT        scouts can ignore enemy zones of control.
END
                         POSSIBLE ARMY STATUS

The following is the list of normally selectable army statuses:

MARCH    :Marching doubles army movement at the expense of combat strength.
         :   One fifth of national moverate is required to stop marching.
SCOUT    :Scout and spy units can have scout status, and will, if possible,
         :   avoid any enemy.  They can move through hostile armies but are
         :   not able to take unowned land.  They are useful to check out
         :   the map and to determine the enemy combat strength.
ATTACK   :Armies in this mode can take owned sectors, initiate
         :   combat, and have they reasonable movement rates.
DEFEND   :In this mode, can take owned sectors and have good defense
         :   and movement, but can not initiate combat.
GARRISON :This mode offers the strongest defense but is used only in YOUR
         :   Towns, Capitol, and castles.  Garrisons may not move.
RULE     :This mode is available to leaders within cities.  It means that
         :   the leader will not participate in battle and may only be
         :   killed if surrounding troops receive more than 80% of damage.
SORTIE   :A quick attack from a fortification. See page on CITY COMBAT.
SIEGE    :An encampment to pin armies in a sector. See page on CITY COMBAT.
END
                         POSSIBLE ARMY STATUS  (page 2)

The following is the list of specialized statuses:

MILITIA  :Militia units have this status, which indicates that they are
         :   unable to move but DO get the bonuses of GARRISON troops.
         :   Militia units are not full time troops, and are intrinsically
         :   weak in combat.
FLIGHT	 :Flying units ignore normal movement costs while moving, and can
         :   cross water.  See the FLIGHT section below.
MAGDEF   :Magically enhanced DEFEND is normal DEFEND mode with a +30% bonus.
         :   You get this status by spending spell points via 'w'izardry
MAGATT   :Magically enhanced ATTACK is normal ATTACK mode with a +30% bonus.
         :   You get this status by spending spell points via 'w'izardry
GROUP    :Members of army groups move at the rate of the slowest unit in
         :   the group.  They gain leader bonuses and have the same
         :   properties in combat as would an army in attack mode.
BESIEGED :A troop which is under siege.  See page on CITY COMBAT.

Due to unit reorganization, switching from one status to another consumes
one point of movement.  (Only march is unchangable with zero movement.)
END
                      CAPTURING SECTORS AND TAKING COUNTRIES

It takes armies greater than 75 AND greater than your total civilians/350 to 
take a sector.  You MUST be either at WAR or in JIHAD with the nation you want
to take the sector from.  Because leader and monster units are really just a
single entity per unit, they do not possess enough men to take sectors.

If one nation captures another nation's Capitol, that Capitol is sacked and
all items kept there are transfered to the conquerer:  metal, gold, jewels and
a fifth of the food supply.  In addition, the nation will be depleted because
it will now lack a Capitol.  That will result in the loss of all monster and
mercenary troops and 30% of it's regular armies and sectors.  If a nation
loses all of it's population and army units, that nation is destroyed.

Mercenaries are not drafted from your populace.  15% of all troops 
disbanded become mercenaries and are added to the mercenary soldier pool 
for potential drafting by any nation.  
END
                              FLIGHT

Some avian units have the ability of flight, these units will have a
status of FLYING automatically set after each update.  Also, magicians
will have the ability to grant flight to individual units.  Flying
units may not be combined with other units, but may be separated as
per normal units.

Flying allows a unit to pass over land and water without being stopped
by enemy troops.  It also allows allows cheaper travel over most
sectors.  The major difference between flying and normal movement is that,
when a flying unit stops its movement, it will have landed, and its
status will become DEFEND, prohibiting any further flight.

NOTE: if a FLYING unit runs out of movement over water, it will drown.
END
                        SHIPS AND SHIP COSTS

There are three types of ships available:

   ship type    cargo/hold      base move     base cost

Warships        combat ships    20            20000
Galleys         100 soldiers    18            25000
Merchants       100 civilians   15            25000

Of each type, there are three classes of ships:

   ship class   holds           move bonus    cost rate

Light           One             +(2*3)        1 x Base
Medium          Two             +3            2 x Base
Heavy           Three           +0            3 x Base

Ship maintenance will cost 4000 per holding space on each update.
(Un)loading costs 4 movement in cities, full movement elsewhere.
END
                           SHIP INFORMATION

     Ships travel in fleets which may contain up to 31 ships of each type
and class.  The movement ability of the fleet is determined by the movement
ability of the slowest member.  It is important to note that it costs 4 move
points to land a fleet and fleets with light ships may not enter deep water.

     Each ship also has a maximum crew of 100/hold.  If the crew is
below the maximum, movement will be reduced by the percentage of crew missing
is until the ship is repaired in harbor.  (via the 'C'onstruct command)

     Also, ships may be loaded (or unloaded) with armies and civilians via
the 't'ransport command.  Only sailors or marines may be unloaded in
unowned sectors and only marines may be unloaded in someone else's land.
The maximum transport capability of a fleet is determined by how many
holds are in the fleet of the proper type.  So, a fleet with 2 medium
merchants and 1 light galley may carry up to 100 soldiers and 4
* 100 civilians.  Loading or unloading of a fleet means the
fleet loses all remaining movement.  NOTE:  Due to the hazards of the
sea, some of the civilians will not survive the trip.
END
                                NOTES ON COMBAT

Towns / Cities / Forts / Capitols result in bloodier battles than normal.  
Battles in these sectors result in 20% more casualties on both sides (so
if there would be 30% casualties, the result is 36% casualties).  Also,
special tactics may be needed in such sectors. See following page.

You can expect to take several turns to reduce a large army, especially
in a Town or Capitol.  NPC defenders will draft new troops each turn.

Combats calculations are based on an even 1:1 battle, and then the results
are adjusted based on the calculated odds of the battle.  First, an initial
roll from 0 to 100 is made with probabilities being an even gaussian
distribution.  Then odds are calculated based on the number of men and their
combat strength, with better soldiers having the same weight as more men of
poorer quality. The losses given by the initial combat roll are then
adjusted by removing from the percent loss of the side the with the better
odds and adding to the percent losses of the side with unfavorable odds.
END
                              CITY COMBAT

In fortified sectors, such as cities, towns, forts and capitols, armies may
perform SORTIES and SIEGES, and may RULE or be BESIEGED.

Cities may issue special SORTIE attacks.  These attacks occur as if 20%
more men are in the unit and they are also given an increase of 10% to attack
bonus.  If a SORTIE unit is caught by an enemy attack it will fight at a -30%
defensive bonus.  Note: once a SORTIE is sent out, it may not be recalled.

Special SORTIE considerations and extra bonuses:
   ARCHERS and CATAPULTS take only half damage due to attacking from walls.
   DRAGOONS, LEGIONS and PHALANX gain +5% to attack.
   LT_CAVALRY and CAVALRY gain +10% to attack.
   KNIGHTS, ELEPHANTS, and AVIAN units gain +15% to attack.
   Summoned MONSTERS gain an additional 5% due to shock.

A leader unit within a fortification may decide to RULE.  This unit
will not participate in any combat and may only be damaged if the
surrounding troops suffer 80% casualties.  This is a good way to protect
national leaders from harm within the Capitol.
END
                          CITY COMBAT (page 2)

If a unit is placed on SIEGE status and there are twice as many units on
siege as there are of the sector owners', any non flying troops will be set
to a status of BESIEGED.  BESIEGED units have a movement of zero and may
only have their status changed to SORTIE.  In addition, defensive bonus
for BESIEGED troops is at -20% after addition of fortification bonuses.

An ideal method of taking a city would be to have four times the troops
inside and set half of your troops on SIEGE and half on ATTACK.

Special Considerations for SIEGES:
   SIEGE engines count triple for calculations of sieging troops.
   MILITIA troops count half for calculations of besieged troops.

The only method to take an occupied City or Capitol is to be the the only army
in the sector when the combat is *over*.  This is VERY difficult, as it should
be.  Fortifications can be damaged in combat by SIEGE ENGINES and CATAPULTS.
END
                          AN EXAMPLE OF COMBAT

A battle occurs in 22,29 (a "good" farm) between your nation "uru" (defender) 
and "edland".  They have 339 infantry vs. 100 of your infantry. Your defensive 
bonus is +70, their attack bonus is +40. Infantry are +0/+0. A movement bonus 
goes to both sides = 5*(9-movecost)=+40.  Their total bonus is 40+40+=+80. 
Yours is 70+40=110. This leads to dice modifier of 30 in your favor.
The roll is 91 which becomes +91-30=61; the defenders base loss is then:
(61+30)/160*60 = 40% and the attackers base loss is then: (160-(61+30))
/160*60 = 20%.  Since the odds favor the attacker, there is a (339/10)-10
adjustment to the defenders losses, bringing their losses to 63%.
The actual loss to each unit is troops * Percent * random / 100, where the 
random is a random value between 0 and 2.  For you this leads
to 84*63*(~1) / 100 = 45 men. for them it leads to 56 men.
Despite your awful luck at the dice, you still came out quite well.

However, because they did cream you, there was a chance that you were
     forced to retreat, which you did to 21 28.

                         MAIL MESSAGE FROM COMBAT

The following is a mail message you might receive after the combat described
on the last page.

BATTLE SUMMARY for sector 22, 29
You are on the Defending Side
 edland is attacking with army 17 (type Infantry, men 125, bonus=80)
 edland is attacking with army 23 (type Infantry, men 160, bonus=80)
 uru is defending with army 9 (type Infantry, men 84, bonus=110)
attacking soldiers=285 -> attackers percent loss 20%
defending soldiers=84 -> defenders percent loss 63%
ODDS are 339 to 100; ADJUSTED ROLL is 61
RESULT: Attackers lose 56 men, Defenders lose 45 men
Additionally, All defenders retreat to 21 28
END
                             NAVAL COMBAT

        Naval Combat is very similar to army combat, except that capturing
of ships is taken into account and fleets within two sectors may
participate in battle.  Odds are calculated based on the amount of crews
for each ships.  Warship crew is added in on a 1 to 1 basis, while Galleys
are at half that, and Merchants are halved again.  Then, any soldiers on
board are added in at half strength except for ARCHERS and SAILORS which
are full strength and MARINES which are twice strength.  If a nation has
SAILOR power, his crews are given a 20% bonus in strength due to better
ability.

        Finally, if a ship is damaged in combat there is a percent
chance based on the odds of combat that that ship will be captured.
At 1:1 odds, only a 15% capture chance exists; At 10:1 odds there is a
60% chance; At >60:1 odds there is a 100% chance; And then if the odds
are against the player, 1:10 has only a 1% chance of capturing, and
below that it drops to 0%.
