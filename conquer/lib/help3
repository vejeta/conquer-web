                                MAGIC POWERS

Magic powers differentiate your nation from all  the  other  nations  in  the
world.  There are three types of powers - truly MAGICAL powers, which usually
involve summoning or spell use, CIVILIAN powers, which are related to civili-
zation  and  trade,  and  MILITARY powers, which measure your ability to make
war.

All nations start with at least one power (based on race or  class)  and  can
purchase  additional  powers by expending jewels.  On the Magic Screen ('M'),
if you have enough jewels, you will be asked if  you  wish  to  buy  a  magic
power.

The magic screen also permits you to see what powers you have, and  to  take-
over ORC nations if you are an ORC nation with the appropriate powers.

                              HOW TO GET MAGIC

Magic powers cost jewels to obtain; the cost to obtain a power  is  based  on
your  nations  magic  ability.   The  formulae for this is to take two to the
power of the sum of the number of powers you have from that type and half the
number of other powers times your base value:

jewel cost for civilian power = Base * 2**( #mgk/2 + #civ + #mil/2 )

                             type of power desired
         race         magical    civilian      military
        elves -         50K         50K           50K
        dwarves -       80K         40K           40K
        humans -       100K         25K           50K
        orcs -         150K         75K           45K

for example a human with 1 of each power wanting a magic power would pay
                100K * 2**(1+1/2+1/2) = 4 *100K jewels

END
                          SPELL CASTING

If a nation has magical spell points, that nation may cast a number of
useful spells.

The current list of spells and their costs:

Summon          -- must have SUMMON to cast this spell; cost is dependent
                    on the monster summoned.  (see next page)
Flight          -- give flight to a unit at a cost of 1 spell pt / 100 men
Enhance Attack  -- 30% increase in attack at a cost of 1 spell pt / 300 men
Enhance Defense -- 30% increase in defense at a cost of 1 spell pt / 300 men

All of the above spells except summoning have an effect area of one army unit
and  a  duration  of one turn.  Flight and the Combat Enhancements each cause
the unit to lose one movement point due to the change in status.
END
                              SUMMONED MONSTERS

A monster unit represents one monster, but is the equivalent in combat of  an
army of the given number of men.  When summoned, they appear in your Capitol,
and are yours to command until you disband them or  can  not  afford  to  pay
their  per/turn  jewel  cost  *and*  5x  that  cost in gold.  Monsters may be
wounded in combat as can normal army units.  Wounded monsters have a  percent
chance of dying based on the percent damage taken (a dragon (1000 men) taking
200 equivalent men of damage has a 20% chance of dying).  Next turn,  however
its  strength  will be fully restored (1000 men again).  A number of the mon-
sters will also have the ability of flight.

Spell points can accumulate from turn to turn, but there is a 25% chance that
half  your  unused  spell points disappear each turn....  This gives you some
incentive to use them.
